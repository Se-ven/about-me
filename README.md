# about-me
Includes first homework assignment
"About Me"
My name is Nick Lavery, I'm formally trained as a classical and jazz musician (tuba and bass trombone player.) A total Renaissance man, I'm also deeply involved in a traditional martial art and currently work as a high end custom instrument builder. I want to become an excellent software engineer that can build interesting and useful things in a supportive and creative environment, all with a work structure that allows me the control to orient my time to continue honing my personal crafts and performing career as well (without starving!!)  

"For Fun"
I build and repair vintage audio gear, huge fan of the original Klipsch loudspeaker designs (and horn loaded loudspeakers in general!) Any free time I have is almost always spent practicing, but to relax I enjoy spending time outside in the mountains and woods and playing with my adorable cat.
